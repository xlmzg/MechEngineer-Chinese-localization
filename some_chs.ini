swarm_1="佃农"
swarm_2="Morphology# The average length of a specimen is 7 meters, height 4 meters, width 5 meters.# The smallest known combat monster. The average weight is 630 kg. #In severe storm conditions, specimens are twice as large.#The body is expanded and slightly flattened. The head is reinforced with two transparent hemispheres of armor covering the compound eyes. Four long limbs reaching the long body and emerging from the mesothorax and metathorax are responsible for locomotion. Two short limbs emerging from the prothorax are reinforced with an additional layer of armor and serve for cutting food. Have advanced sound echolocation."
swarm_3="Biology# They lead an extremely active but short life in colonies, from 2 minutes to 5 days. Lifespan can be severely shortened by failing to complete a task within the time limit set by the hive at birth.# Thanks to echolocation and movable abdominal scales can exchange information with other monsters at a distance of up to 600 meters. In large concentrations, due to information noise, they are less likely to rely on echolocation. Facet vision badly captures small details and movement. #The general activity of all species is associated with the melody of the nearest hive. During the activity phase, they run twice as fast and spawn more often from Ovums. This phase lasts about 16 seconds. The break before the next activity is about 28 seconds.#Unable to reproduce on their own. The frequency of spawning from Ovums also depends on the distance to the nearest underground hive.# Distributed throughout the entire planet. Quickly adapts to any climate and terrain.##Takes significantly less damage from energy-type weapon projectiles."

egg_3="Biology# Residential lifestyle in one place. Sometimes migrating with Colubra. Lifespan is unknown. If there is no foreign organism within 900 meters of one of the surface roots, Ovum conserves energy and constantly adapts the hive's core genome to the current environment.# If the boundary is violated, Ovum will start producing Operarius and other creatures at a frequency set by the hive melody. During the active phase, the incubator heats up and the frequency of creating new creatures can reach four Operarius per second.# The ability to create special creatures depends on the program received from Colubra.

If not, then it reduces the target's armor by damage divided by 100.###The enemy deals damage to the mechs differently. If the mech's armor is less than the enemy's damage, then the mech takes a point of damage and checks if the pilot was hit.
